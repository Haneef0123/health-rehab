# ðŸš€ Quick Start

Use this guide when you onboard a new machine or reset the workspace. It mirrors the expectations in `AGENTS.md` and keeps Codex aligned with the latest repo state.

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20** (see `.nvmrc`)
- **npm** (included with Node.js)
- A modern browser (Chrome, Edge, or Safari) for IndexedDB support

## 2. Install & Run

```bash
# Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/health-rehab.git
cd health-rehab

# Use Node 20
nvm use 20    # or install via asdf/volta if preferred

# Install dependencies (one command, clean workspace)
npm install

# Launch the app
npm run dev
```

Visit **http://localhost:3000/dashboard**. The landing page redirects automatically.

## 3. Recommended workflow

1. Open the dashboard and perform a full manual smoke test (pain log, exercise session, medication toggle).
2. Make changes in a feature branch, keeping the domain safety rules from `AGENTS.md` front-of-mind.
3. Add or update tests as you touch stores/components.
4. Run `npm run build` before you share results with Haneef.

## 4. Key project docs

- `AGENTS.md` â€“ summary instructions Codex reads automatically.
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` â€“ complete safety/performance charter.
- `.specify/memory/architecture.md` â€“ data models, storage, and planned integrations.
- `.specify/memory/design-system.md` â€“ UI tokens, accessibility expectations.

If you rely on Codex, copy `.codex/config.template.toml` to `~/.codex/config.toml` so those deep docs are ingested automatically.

## 5. Troubleshooting

- **Build errors**: run `npm run build` locally; resolve TypeScript issues before continuing.
- **IndexedDB issues**: clear browser storage for `http://localhost:3000` to reset seed data.
- **Dependency drift**: install packages one at a time (`npm install <name>`) to keep diffs and failures obvious, per the constitution.

You are now ready to iterate safely on the rehabilitation assistant. Take care of the medical disclaimers and keep the UX snappy. ðŸ’™
